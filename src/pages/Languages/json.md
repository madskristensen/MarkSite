## Schema based Intellisense
By leveraging JSON Schema it is now easier than ever to work with JSON
documents.

This example shows how it's like working with a 
[Web Manifest](http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/) JSON document.

to help make it clear what the various properties mean.

## Comments
Most modern JSON parsers supports comments and so does Visual Studio.

Simply hit the global keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+K+C` to add a comment
or `Ctrl+K+U` to uncomment the line or selection.

other potential issues, such as duplicate properties.
