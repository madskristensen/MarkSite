## Advanced auto-completion
The Intellisense engine provides accurate auto-completion for
classes, IDs and attribute names and values, which can sometimes
be hard to remember.

## Hierarchical indentation
Keep your CSS file nice and organized using hierarchical indentation.

The indentation of the CSS rulesets are based on the cascading order
of the selectors. Just format the document using `Ctrl+K+D` to
hierarchical indent cascading rulesets.
